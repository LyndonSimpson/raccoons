In Formula 1, the Gallet MultiChron Model 12 was notably worn by Jim Clark, especially during his triumphant 1965 Indianapolis 500 win. This model's presence in racing is complemented by the Gallet Dual-Timer's role as a timekeeper in the early days of the Indy 500 races. In yachting, Gallet's innovation is exemplified by the 1915 Yachting Timer, the first watch designed for yacht racing. Additionally, Senator Harry S. Truman, later U.S. President, endorsed the Gallet Flight Officer for the US Air Force, further highlighting the brand's diverse appeal."
